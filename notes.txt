Difference Between Inheritance and Composition

Inheritance is used to define a relationship between two classes where one class inherits the 
methods and characteristics of another class, while composition is used to define a relationship 
between two classes where one class contains the other class as an attribute.

Inheritance allows for code reuse and is used to define a "is-a" relationship between classes,
while composition allows for more flexibility and is used to define a "has-a" relationship between 
classes. 

In Python, the syntax for inheritance is to use the class keyword followed by the parent 
class within parentheses, while the syntax for composition is to define an instance of another 
class as an attribute within the current class.

Packages 

Packages contain modules, subpackages or other resources such as static data 
or image files. 
Packages can be imported and used in programs by using the ‘import’ 
statement

How to Write Package
 
First create a directory and add an empty init.py file in it to tell Python that the 
current directory is a package. Then add modules to the package by adding files with the .py file 
extension. Inside the package, you can create multiple sub-packages by creating additional 
directories, and add the init.py file in each of them. Finally, you can import the package 
into other modules or scripts using the import statement.

Triple quotes in Python

Triple quotes (''' python """) are used to create strings that span multiple lines. 
This allows you to write longer strings without having to escape newline characters.
